# CalcScape
Tools for OSRS/RS3 using JS/jQuery with a Bootstrap'd front end. Database managed via PostgresSQL. 

Currently working on accuracy/hitchance for RS3. Looking to store boss data/drop tables in PostgresSQL for luckscape calculator.
Will likely work on OSRS hit rolls/drop tables in the coming weeks.
